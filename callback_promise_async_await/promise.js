// Promises were invented to solve the problem of callback hell and to better handle our tasks.

/****
 * A promise has three states:
 *     ---> Pending: This is the initial stage. Nothing happens here. Think of it like this,your customer
 *                   is taking their time giving you an order. But they haven't ordered anything yet.
 *     ---> Resolved: This means that your customer has received their food and is happy.
 *     ---> Rejected: This means that your customer didn't receive their order and left the restaurant.
